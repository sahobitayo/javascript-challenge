# Javascript-challenge

I was assigned to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a [dataset](https://github.com/sahobitayo/javascript-challenge/blob/master/UFO-level-1/static/js/data.js) provided. I will also need to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values using pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages.
There are two sites available:

1. [Date Search](https://sahobitayo.github.io/javascript-challenge/UFO-level-1/index.html)
- This site allows you to do a quick search for UFO sightings and filter those search results by a specific date a UFO sighting was reported.
- The code for this site is available in the [UFO-level-1](https://github.com/sahobitayo/javascript-challenge/tree/master/UFO-level-1) folder of this repository.

2. [Multiple Search](https://sahobitayo.github.io/javascript-challenge/UFO-level-2/index.html)
- This site includes everything from the first site, but in addition, this site allows you to set multiple filters and do a more advanced search on specific criteria, including date, city, state, country, and shape.
- The code for this site is available in the [UFO-level-2](https://github.com/sahobitayo/javascript-challenge/tree/master/UFO-level-2) folder of this repository.
